## Design Analysis

### Cohesion and Coupling

The project aims to maintain high cohesion within classes and loose coupling between them. The `EvilHangman` class is responsible for the user interface and controlling the game flow, while the `EvilSolution` class manages the game state and logic.

### Challenges

Refactoring the code to implement patterns for improved cohesion and coupling is challenging.
